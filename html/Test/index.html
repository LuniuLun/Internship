        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>
            Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of
            <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a
            well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the
            longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        </p>
        <p>
            She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming
            that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her
            pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be
            an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
