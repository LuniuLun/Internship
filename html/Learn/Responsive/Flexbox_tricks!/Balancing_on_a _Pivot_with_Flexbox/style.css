/* The key to this balance is to divide it into two parts, the head and the tail, 
with the axis point in the middle called the privot. 
The head is set attribute order: 1 => will be located behind the tail because the tail has the order attribute value: 2.
(the lower values are in front of the higher points)
However, if you continue to set the margin-right:50%(with condition having position: relative) property for the head, 
it will fly to the left and vice versa, set the margin-left:50% property for the first part
=> the tail will fly to the right. Very cool */
